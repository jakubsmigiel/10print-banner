# Generative Banner
A bit of code that generates a 10 print pattern in one on the specified color palettes and sets the result as the banner on a Pleroma account. I made it run as a cronjob every day at midnight.

You can see some generated examples in the [examples](examples) folder.

## Usage

In [generate_set_banner.py](generate_set_banner.py):
1. Set the OAuth token used to access the Pleroma API with privileges to edit your account. I used [this site](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/mastodon-bot/).
2. Set the base url of the Pleroma instance.
```py
OAUTH_TOKEN = 'OAUTH_TOKEN'
base_url = 'https://example.com'
```

Run
```
python3 generate_set_banner.py
```

This will generate a banner using a randomly picked color palette from a list in the code and set it as the banner on your fedi account.
